# SMS Spam Detection

This project implements a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately identify spam messages. The process involves:
1. Loading and exploring the dataset.
2. Preprocessing the text data.
3. Converting text data into numerical features.
4. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
5. Training a Logistic Regression model.
6. Evaluating the model's performance.
7. Using the trained model to predict new messages.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "SMS Spam Collection Dataset". It contains SMS messages labeled as either "spam" or "ham".

## Setup

To run this notebook, you will need to have the following libraries installed:
